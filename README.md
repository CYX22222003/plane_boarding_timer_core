This respository is to store the 2022 IMMC Singapore materials from ACJC team. It includes the written report and code for simulation. The boarding_plan_core.py is programme that uses a different approach from the one presented in the written report.

# 2022 IMMC Singapore: Aboard! Boarding and Disembarking a Plane: core simulation for plane boarding timer
## Background
In air transportation, efficiency is time and time is money. Even small delays in the schedules
of passenger airplanes result in lost time for both air carriers and their passengers. During any
passenger flight, there are two time-consuming operations that depend mostly on human
behavior: boarding and disembarking the aircraft.
In commercial passenger air travel, airlines use various boarding and disembarking methods
from completely unstructured (passengers board or leave the plane without guidance) to
structured (passengers board or leave the plane using a prescribed method). Prescribed
methods may be based on row numbers, seat positions, or priority groups. In practice,
however, even when the prescribed method is announced, not all passengers follow the
instructions.
The boarding process includes the movement of passengers from the entrance of the aircraft
to their assigned seats. This movement can be hindered by aisle and seat interference. For
example, many passengers have carry-on bags which they stow into the overhead bins
before taking their seats. Each time a passenger stops to stow a bag, the queue of other
passengers stops because narrow aircraft aisles allow only one passenger to pass at a time.
Another hindrance is that some seats (e.g., window seats) are unreachable if other seats (e.g.,
aisle seats) are already occupied. When this occurs, some passengers must stand up and move
into the aisle so other passengers can reach their seats.
The disembarking process is the opposite of boarding with its own possible hindrances to
passenger movement. Some passengers are simply slow getting out of their seat and row, or
slow moving to the exit. Passengers also block the aisle while collecting their belongings
from either their seat or from the overhead bin forcing passengers behind them in the aircraft
to wait.

## Requirements:

Create plane boarding and disembarking methods that will be the most time-
effective in real practice.

Construct a mathematical model or models to calculate total aircraft boarding and
disembarking times. Ensure your model is adaptable to various prescribed
boarding/disembarking methods and varying numbers of carry-on bags to be stowed, as well
as accounts for passengers who do not follow the prescribed boarding/disembarking methods.

Apply your model to the standard “narrow-body” aircraft shown in Figure 1.
